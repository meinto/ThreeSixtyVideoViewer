## ThreeSixtyVideoViewer

A different approach to 360 degrees product viewers.

I made this library because all the 360 degrees product viewers where image based and I wanted one, which is video based. The idea is, that we scrub through frames while panning over the video area.

Currently this library is a minimal valuable product to demonstrate the possibility and should therefore not be used in production.
